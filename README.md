# share-portfolio-tracker
Experimenting with the yfinance package to track portfolio values over time

Still lots to do with this project, however the basic plan is as follows: 

- Create a simple interface that can operate out of browser

- Allow user to enter in stock purchases and sales at any date, keeping track of previous inputs entered. This will require the program to store previous inputs, prices, dates etc. Will likely need to continually update a list in another python file. 

- Show a basic time series plot of the total value of the portfolio over time.
